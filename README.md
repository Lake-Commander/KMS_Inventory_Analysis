## Interpretation

- üöö **Delivery Truck** has the highest average shipping cost across *all* order priorities (~‚Ç¶43‚Äì‚Ç¶47), contrary to the assumption it is the most economical shipping method.
  
- ‚úàÔ∏è **Express Air**, traditionally considered the fastest and most expensive, shows **lower average shipping costs (~‚Ç¶6.8‚Äì‚Ç¶8.7)** than Delivery Truck in this dataset, which is unexpected.

- The **shipping mode usage does not strongly correlate with order priority**:  
  - Critical orders use Delivery Truck and Express Air fairly evenly.  
  - Low priority orders also use Express Air and Regular Air a lot, which could be unnecessarily expensive/faster than required.

- üìâ **Low priority orders using fast shipping (Express Air, Regular Air) suggest possible overspending** on shipping for orders that do not require urgency.

- üü° **Overall, the data suggests the company is not effectively aligning shipping cost and speed with order priority.** There seems to be weak enforcement of priority-based shipping policies.

---

## Conclusion

The company **does not appear to be spending shipping costs appropriately based on Order Priority**, as expensive shipping modes are frequently used for low priority orders and the supposedly economical method (Delivery Truck) is actually the costliest. This indicates opportunities for cost savings by enforcing stricter shipping mode selection based on order priority.

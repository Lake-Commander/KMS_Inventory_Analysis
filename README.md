## 🎯 Project Highlights

- Revenue breakdown by category, region and customer
- High- and low-performing customers and products

## 📈 Analytical Approach

- **SQL Queries:** Performed aggregations and filtering with `GROUP BY`, `WHERE`, and subqueries  
- **Data Segmentation:** Based on region, category, customer segment and shipping mode  
- **Performance Metrics:** Top 10 customers, order frequency, shipping cost averages  
- **Comparative Insights:** Sales vs. profitability, product vs. location, cost vs. delivery mode

---

## 📊 Summary of Results

### 🔹 Product Insights
- **Technology** was the top-selling category (~₦6M in total sales)
- **Ontario** recorded no appliance sales – a red flag for supply/demand gaps

### 🔹 Regional Performance
- **Top 3 Regions:** West, Ontario, Prarie  
- **Bottom 3 Regions:** Nunavut, Northwest Territories, Yukon – need marketing support

### 🔹 Customer Insights
- **Top Customer:** Emily Phan (~₦117K in sales)
- **Bottom 10 Customers:** All spent less than ₦500 – targeted retention strategy advised

### 🔹 Shipping Cost Review
- **Delivery Truck** was the most expensive method (~₦52K total) despite being the slowest  
- Express Air, although fastest, was often cheaper and used even for low-priority orders  
- Weak alignment between **Order Priority** and **Shipping Mode**

---

## 🧠 Key Recommendations

- Promote high-margin Technology products through upsell campaigns  
- Investigate and resolve the Ontario appliance sales void  
- Align shipping decisions with order priority to reduce inefficiencies  
- Activate loyalty programs or bundled offers for underperforming customers
